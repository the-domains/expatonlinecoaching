About Phil

I'm originally from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada and have lived in Singapore and New Zealand for over ten years. I work with professionals and parents as well as children and teens to help with the challenges, opportunities and pitfalls of life as a global nomad. Both my children were born in Singapore and are growing up as Third Culture Kids\*.  

When it comes to how I work, I focus on helping my clients find solutions to their problems. There is value in talking about problems, but I find that there are always exceptions to the problem, times when the problem isn't occurring or occurring less. Those exceptions are one of our most valuable tools moving forward. I believe that you are the experts in your own life, and by building on your strengths and abilities, we will achieve better results faster, putting you on the path to success and me hopefully out of a job! 

\*Third Culture Kids - Kids raised in a different culture than that of their parents. A must read book by[Pollock and Van Reken][0].
